            <h2>Biography</h2>

            <div>
                <p>I am an 18 year old college student currently enrolled at Raritan Valley Community College, with a major of User Interface and Web Development. I have originally aspired to be a UI/UX Designer, yet I am still not completely confident in my decision. I do not currently have any job experience, but I have always had a love for design. I have naturally been able to make decent looking presentations documents, and more through my creativity.</p>

                <p>There is nothing in with beautiful green earth that I love more than my two cats, Lily and Tater Tot. They have awoken a fierce obsession of cats within me, I didn't always praise cats. Back when I was only 10 years old, I had the world's biggest panda obsession, both giant pandas and red pandas. However, I loved red pandas more. They are so adorable, who wouldn't love them? One day, this panda obsession came to an abrupt end when I was 13. I got a cat. A beautiful soft perfect angel, glowing due to it's sheer holiness. Although not the most affectionate, and fairly shy, she was there for me to forcefully cuddle her in the darkest of times. I then became a violently obsessed cat lady. Years later, a series of unfortunate evens unfolded and I got another cat. Tater Tot. His orange fluff with the most idiotic expression makes all the people swoon. He is a living tornado though.. And, despite what others may say, I love them equally. </p>

                <p>"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject."</p>

                <p>"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."</p>
