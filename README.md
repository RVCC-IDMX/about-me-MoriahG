### Description
The purpose of this project was to learn web development and hone my skills. Throughout the course of creating this webpage, I have learned and implemented HTML, images, links, Github, Netlify, CSS, flex and grid, media states, embedded media, forms, and a navigation bar. When creating this project, there were many design choices I wish I could have done, but I did not have the time nor will to handle coding it all. Additionally, the image hover affects blog had to be left unfinished for the sake of time and the navbar hamburger icon wasn't created either.

The color scheme of this page was created due to my love for brutalist architechture.
Main colors:
- red `#8C0900` `rgb(138, 9, 0)`
- green `#35533a` `rgb(54, 84, 59)`
- yellow `#f7d633` `rgb(246, 214, 49)`

Background colors:
- beige `#f8efe0` `rgb(248, 240, 226)`
- darker beige `#e1d8c7` `rgb(225, 216, 199)`

To fit the brutalist architechture theme, I chose the fonts,

Stalinist One for titles

Chakra Petch for default

My logo was made to match the colors of my webpage, however, I knew when I was designing it, it would not fully match the aesthetic of the website.
I decided to make it my initials, and utilize the top points of the M as cat ears and give it a catlike appearing, but not do anything crazy that'll make it unreadable or replace the M.
