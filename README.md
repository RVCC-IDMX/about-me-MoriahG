### Description
The purpose of this project was to learn web development and hone my skills. Throughout the course of creating this webpage, I have learned and implemented HTML, images, links, Github, Netlify, CSS, flex and grid, media states, embedded media, forms, and a navigation bar. This color scheme was created in mind of good contrasting colors, the reds and blues, to compliment the pink and blues in the placer avatar and Bob logo. (HEXs and visuals will be provided once renovated)
