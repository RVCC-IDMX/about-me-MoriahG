### Description
The purpose of this project was to learn web development and hone my skills. Throughout the course of creating this webpage, I have learned and implemented HTML, images, links, Github, Netlify, CSS, flex and grid, media states, embedded media, forms, and a navigation bar. This color scheme was created due to my love for brutalist architechture, and the shades and colors of red, green, and yellow fit along side that.
